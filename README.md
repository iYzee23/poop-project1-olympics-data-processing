# poop-project1-olympics-data-processing
Cpp program (part of faculty course) that analyzes and processes data from .txt files in certain format. Main focus of this project was abundant use of standard collections (ie. maps, sets, vectors, lists), algorithms from Cpp algorithm header and parsing using regex and matchers. Console-based application, where user can choose filters to get wanted output. Second project was on the same topic, but GUI orriented and written in Java/Cpp with intentions to link them through the .dll libraries, but is hidden to due academic integrity. Minor errors present here were fixed in the second project
